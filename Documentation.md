Feature overview
----------------

### Change tracking

Know when attributes change.

```js
var User = Ento()
  .attr('firstName')
  .attr('lastName');

var me = new User();

// when `firstName` changes
me.on('change:firstName', function() { ... });

// when anything changes
me.on('change', function() { ... });

// triggers the two events above
me.firstName = "Jacques";
```

### Case normalization

### Persistence

### Validations

### Relations

### States

When operations are done like [fetch()] or [save()], the state is saved into an 
object called `is`.

```js
book.is.fresh    // hasn't been modified since instanciation
book.is.new      // has an ID
book.is.busy     // is fetching/saving/deleting
book.is.fetching // is currently fetching
book.is.loaded   // has been fetched
book.is.saving   // is currently saving
book.is.deleting // is currently being deleted
book.is.deleted  // has been deleted
book.is.error    // persistence errors
```

Change events are also triggered for this.

```js
book.on('change:is', function () {
  // status has changed, do something
});
```

Instances
---------

### instance.get
> .get(attr)

Return the value of the given attribute *attr*. This is the
same as using the getter, except it can do reserved keywords as
well.

```js
var Document = Ento()
  .attr('title')
  .attr('author');

var doc = new Document();
```

Use `instance.get(str)`. This is equivalent to accessing `instance[str]`

```js
doc.title = "Manual";
doc.get('title')  //=> "Manual"
doc.title         //=> "Manual"
```

You can also `.get(array)`:

```js
doc.get('title', 'author');
=>
```

### instance.trigger
> .trigger(event, [args])

Triggers an event `event`. Also triggers the event in the
constructor.

### intsance.toJSON
> .toJSON()

Exports as a JSON-like object for serialization.

[fetch()]: #fetch
[save()]: #save
